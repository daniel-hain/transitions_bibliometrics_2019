Workflow and preliminary findings findings for our 2019 bibliometric analysis of the field of "sustainability transitions"



# Preliminary Results
In the following, you will find the first preliminary results and description of the workflow so far. Further details on the method can be read up in [Rakas & Hain (2018)](https://raw.githack.com/daniel-hain/transitions_bibliometrics_2019/master/docs/The_Development_of_Innovation_System_Research_R_R1.pdf). I here only report the results, but the full scripts used can be found in the `R` folder.
